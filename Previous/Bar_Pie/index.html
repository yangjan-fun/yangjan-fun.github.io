            <h1 align="center">2019 World Population by Continent (in millions)
            <br>with Age Distribution</h1>
            <p>By 2019, the world's population had reached 7.7 billion. Globally, about 26% of the world's population is under the age of 15 and about 9% is over 65. In Europe, the gap is much smaller, with 16% of the population under 15 and 18% over 65. With the exception of a few countries, such as the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, population growth rates have fallen sharply in many regions. Fertility rates may be high in these high-growth countries, where women have an average of five or more children. However, about 50% of the world's population lives in low-fertility countries, where women have fewer than 2.1 children. In Europe, where most of the population used to be working-age adults with few dependents, the trend is expected to reverse soon, with many developed countries expected to have more elderly people than the young by 2050.</p>
